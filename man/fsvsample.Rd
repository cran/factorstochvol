}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Data matrix. Each of \code{m} rows is assumed to contain a single
(univariate) series of length \code{n}.}

\item{factors}{Number of latent factors to be estimated.}

\item{draws}{Number of MCMC draws kept after burn-in.}

\item{burnin}{Number of initial MCMC draws to be discarded.}

\item{priormu}{Vector of length 2 denoting prior mean and standard deviation
for unconditional levels of the idiosyncratic log-variance processes.}

\item{priorphiidi}{Vector of length 2, indicating the shape parameters for the
Beta prior distributions of the transformed parameters \code{(phi+1)/2}, where
\code{phi} denotes the persistence of the idiosyncratic log-variances.}

\item{priorphifac}{Vector of length 2, indicating the shape parameters for the
Beta prior distributions of the transformed parameters \code{(phi+1)/2}, where
\code{phi} denotes the persistence of the factor log-variances.}

\item{priorsigmaidi}{Vector of length \code{m} containing the
prior volatilities of log-variances. If \code{priorsigmaidi} has exactly
one element, it will be recycled for all idiosyncratic log-variances.}

\item{priorsigmafac}{Vector of length \code{factors} containing the
prior volatilities of log-variances. If \code{priorsigmafac} has exactly
one element, it will be recycled for all factor log-variances.}

\item{priorfacload}{Either a matrix of dimensions \code{m} times \code{factors}
with nonnegative elements or a single number. If a matrix is provided, its
elements are the standard deviations of the Gaussian prior distributions for
the factor loadings. If a single nonnegative number is provided, it will be
recycled accordingly. If a single negative number is provided, a Normal-Gamma
shrinkage prior for the factor loadings is assumed, where \code{-priorfacload}
is interpreted as the shrinkage parameter \code{a}.}

\item{priorng}{Two-element vector with positive entries indicating the Gamma
hyperprior's hyperhyperparameters \code{c} and \code{d}.}

\item{columnwise}{Set to \code{TRUE} if you want to use column-wise shrinkage
and to \code{FALSE} for row-wise shrinkage. For details please see the paper
by Kastner et al. (2017).}

\item{priorh0idi}{Vector of length 1 or \code{m}, containing
information about the Gaussian prior for the initial idiosyncratic
log-variances.
If an element of \code{priorh0idi} is a nonnegative number, the conditional
prior of the corresponding initial log-variance h0 is assumed to be Gaussian
with mean 0 and standard deviation \code{priorh0idi} times $sigma$.
If an element of
\code{priorh0idi} is the string 'stationary', the prior of the corresponding
initial log volatility is taken to be from the stationary distribution, i.e.
h0 is assumed to be Gaussian with mean 0 and variance $sigma^2/(1-phi^2)$.}

\item{priorh0fac}{Vector of length 1 or \code{factors}, containing
information about the Gaussian prior for the initial factor
log-variances.
If an element of \code{priorh0fac} is a nonnegative number, the conditional
prior of the corresponding initial log-variance h0 is assumed to be Gaussian
with mean 0 and standard deviation \code{priorh0fac} times $sigma$.
If an element of
\code{priorh0fac} is the string 'stationary', the prior of the corresponding
initial log volatility is taken to be from the stationary distribution, i.e.
h0 is assumed to be Gaussian with mean 0 and variance $sigma^2/(1-phi^2)$.}

\item{thin}{Single number greater or equal to 1, coercible to integer.
Every \code{thin}th MCMC draw is kept and returned. The default value
is 1, corresponding to no thinning of the draws, i.e. every draw is
stored.}

\item{keeptime}{Either a number coercible to a positive integer, or a string
equal to "all" or "last". If a number different from 1 is provided, only every
\code{keeptime}th latent log-volatility is being monitored. If, e.g.,
\code{keeptime = 3}, draws for the latent log-variances
\code{h_1,h_4,h_7,...} will
be kept. If \code{keeptime} is set to "all", this is equivalent to setting it
to 1. If
\code{keeptime} is set to "last" (the default), only draws for the very last
latent log-variances h_n are kept.}

\item{runningstore}{Because most machines these days do not have enough memory
to store all draws for all points in time, setting \code{runningstore} to an
integer greater than 0 will cause \code{fsvsample} to store the first
\code{runningstoremoments}
ergodic moments of certain variables of interest. More specifically, mean,
variance, skewness, etc. will be stored for certain variables
if \code{runningstore} is set to a value...
\itemize{
 \item{\code{>= 1}: }{Latent log-variances \code{h_1,h_2,...,h_(n+r)}.}
 \item{\code{>= 2}: }{Latent factors \code{f_1,...,f_r}.}
 \item{\code{>= 3}: }{Latent volatilities \code{sqrt(exp(h_1,h_2,...,h_(n+r)))}.}
 \item{\code{>= 4}: }{Conditional covariance matrix and the square roots of its
                     diagonal elements.}
 \item{\code{>= 5}: }{Conditional correlation matrix.}
 \item{\code{>= 6}: }{Communalities, i.e. proportions of variances explained
                     through the common factors.}
}}

\item{runningstorethin}{How often should the calculation of running moments be
conducted? Set to a value > 1 if you want to avoid time consuming calculations
at every MCMC iteration.}

\item{runningstoremoments}{Selects how many running moments (up to 4) should be
calculated.}

\item{quiet}{Logical value indicating whether the progress bar and other
informative output during sampling should be omitted. The default
value is \code{FALSE}, implying verbose output.}

\item{restrict}{Either "upper", "none", or "auto", indicating whether
the factor loadings
matrix should be restricted to have zeros above the diagonal ("upper"), 
whether all elements should be estimated from the data ("none"), or
whether the function \code{\link{findrestrict}} should be invoked for a
priori finding suitable zeros. Setting
\code{restrict} to "upper" or "auto" often stabilizes MCMC
estimation and can be important for identifying the factor loadings matrix,
however, it generally is a strong prior assumption. Setting
\code{restrict} to "none" is usually the preferred option if identification
of the factor loadings matrix is of less concern but covariance estimation
or prediction is the goal. Alternatively, \code{restrict} can be a
logical matrix
of dimension \code{c(m, r)} indicating which elements should be unrestricted
(where \code{restrict} is \code{FALSE}) or zero (where \code{restrict} is
\code{TRUE}).}

\item{interweaving}{The following values for interweaving the factor loadings
are accepted:
\itemize{
 \item{0: }{No interweaving.}
 \item{1: }{Shallow interweaving through the diagonal entries.}
 \item{2: }{Deep interweaving through the diagonal entries.}
 \item{3: }{Shallow interweaving through the largest absolute entries in each column.}
 \item{4: }{Deep interweaving through the largest absolute entries in each column.}
}
For details please see Kastner et al. (2017).
A value of 4 is the highly recommended default.}

\item{signswitch}{Set to \code{TRUE} to turn on a random sign switch of
factors and loadings. Note that the signs of each factor loadings matrix column
and the corresponding factor cannot be identified from the likelihood.}

\item{heteroskedastic}{Vector of length 1, 2, or \code{m + factors},
containing logical values indicating whether time-varying
(\code{heteroskedastic = TRUE}) or constant (\code{heteroskedastic = FALSE})
variance should be estimated.
If \code{heteroskedastic} is of length 2 it will be recycled accordingly,
whereby the first element is used for all idiosyncratic variances and
the second element is used for all factor variances.}

\item{priorhomoskedastic}{Only used if at least one element of
\code{heteroskedastic} is set to \code{FALSE}. In that case,
\code{priorhomoskedastic} must be must be a matrix with positive entries
and dimension c(factors + m, 2). Values in column 1 will be interpreted as
shape and values in column 2 will be interpreted as the rate parameter
of the corresponding inverse gamma prior distribution.}

\item{expert}{\emph{optional} named list of expert parameters for the
univariate SV models (will be passed to the \code{stochvol} package). For most
applications, the default values probably work best. Interested users are
referred to Kastner and Fr√ºhwirth-Schnatter (2014) and Kastner (2016). If
\code{expert} is provided, it may contain the following named elements:
\itemize{
 \item{\code{parameterization}: }{Character string equal to \code{"centered"},
       \code{"noncentered"}, \code{"GIS_C"}, or \code{"GIS_NC"}. Defaults to
       \code{"GIS_C"}.}
 \item{\code{mhcontrol}: }{Single numeric value controlling the proposal
       density of a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) update step when sampling
       \code{sigma}. If \code{mhcontrol} is smaller than 0, an independence
       proposal will be used, while values greater than zero control the
       stepsize of a log-random-walk proposal. Defaults to \code{-1}.}
 \item{\code{gammaprior}: }{Single logical value indicating whether a Gamma
       prior for \code{sigma^2} should be used. If set to \code{FALSE},
       an Inverse Gamma prior is employed. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
 \item{\code{truncnormal}: }{Single logical value indicating whether a
       truncated Gaussian distribution should be used as proposal for
       draws of \code{phi}. If set to \code{FALSE}, a regular Gaussian
       prior is employed and the draw is immediately discarded when values
       outside the unit ball happen to be drawn. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
 \item{\code{mhsteps}: }{Either \code{1}, \code{2}, or \code{3}. Indicates
       the number of blocks used for drawing from the posterior of the
       parameters. Defaults to \code{2}.}
 \item{\code{proposalvar4sigmaphi}: }{Single positive number indicating the
       conditional prior variance of \code{sigma*phi} in the ridge
       \emph{proposal} density for sampling \code{(mu, phi)}.
       Defaults to \code{10^8}.}
 \item{\code{proposalvar4sigmatheta}: }{Single positive number indicating
       the conditional prior variance of \code{sigma*theta} in the ridge
       \emph{proposal} density for sampling \code{(mu, phi)}.
       Defaults to \code{10^12}.}
}}

\item{startpara}{\emph{optional} named list, containing the starting values
for the parameter draws. If supplied, \code{startpara} must contain three
elements named \code{mu} (vector of length \code{m}), \code{phi} (vector
of length \code{m+r}) and \code{sigma} (vector of length \code{m+r}).
The elements of \code{mu} can be arbitrary numerical values, the
\code{phi}s must be real numbers between \code{-1} and \code{1}, and
the \code{sigma}s must be positive real numbers.}

\item{startlatent}{\emph{optional} numeric matrix of dimension
\code{c(n, m + factors)}, containing the starting values of the
latent log-variances.}

\item{startlatent0}{\emph{optional} numeric vector of length
\code{m + factors}, containing the starting values of the initial latent
log-variances.}

\value{
The value returned is a list object of class \code{fsvdraws} holding
 \itemize{
 \item{f}{Array containing factor draws from the posterior distribution.}
 \item{para}{Array containing parameter draws form the posterior distribution.}
 \item{h}{Array containing idiosyncratic and factor log-variance draws.}
 \item{facload}{Array containing draws from the posterior distribution of the
                factor loadings matrix.}
 \item{y}{Matrix containing the data supplied.}
 \item{runningstore}{List whose elements contain ergodic moments of certain
                     variables of interest. See argument
                     \code{runningstore} for details about what
                     is being stored here.}
}
To display the output, use \code{print}, \code{summary} and \code{plot}.
The \code{print} method simply prints the posterior draws (which is very
likely a lot of output); the \code{summary} method displays the summary
statistics currently stored in the object; the \code{plot} method
\code{\link{plot.fsvdraws}} gives a graphical overview.
